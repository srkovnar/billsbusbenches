Code for Bill's Bus Benches website

# Development Notes and Attributions

This website is built using Bootstrap CSS framework: [https://getbootstrap.com]

The map is built with Leaflet.js ([https://leafletjs.com/])
and uses OpenStreetMap map data ([https://www.openstreetmap.org]).

## Before development

Before you can do anything, you must run `composer install` to install PHP dependencies.
Honestly, this project doesn't really use them right now, but I'm leaving them in for now.
